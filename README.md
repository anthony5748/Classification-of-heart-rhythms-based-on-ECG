# ECG-Classification
Electrocardiography is a diagnostic method, which register and represent graphically the changes in electrical activity of the heart. Cardiac rhythm may be generated from different location in the heart. Physiologically, rhythm of the heart is generated in sinus node, which is located in right atrium. In different clinical situations cardiac rhythm may be generated by other pacemakers. Some of these pacemakers may by located in atria outside the sinus node or in heart ventricles. Depending on location of pacemaker the shape of ECG curve may differ. In this project I have trained Logistic Regression model, Support Vector Machine Classifier and XGBoost model that classify five types of ECG curves.

I have trained and tested those algorithms using data, which I downloaded from Kaggle dataset “ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset”

In these data there are 5 different ECG groups to classify:
1.	Normal beat
2.	Supraventricular premature beat
3.	Premature ventricular contraction 
4.	Fusion of ventricular and normal beat 
5.	Different beat
